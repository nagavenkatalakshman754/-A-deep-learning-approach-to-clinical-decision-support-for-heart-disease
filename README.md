# -A-deep-learning-approach-to-clinical-decision-support-for-heart-disease
# Overview
This study aims to develop a clinical decision support system (CDSS) that leverages deep learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients. By analyzing various clinical and demographic data, the system seeks to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding diagnosis and treatment. The deep learning model is trained on a comprehensive dataset, enabling it to identify patterns and risk factors associated with heart disease. Ultimately, this project aims to enhance early detection, improve patient management, and reduce the overall burden of cardiovascular diseases by providing accurate and timely predictions to clinicians.
